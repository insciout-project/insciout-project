# InSciOut Project

The InSciOut database is an open repository of data collected from our randomised controlled trial looking at the influence of press releases on news. For more information on the trial see: http://sites.cardiff.ac.uk/insciout/rct/

The database is in .sqlite3 format and compiles the coding sheets for press releases (PR), journal articles (JA) and news stories. The raw coding sheets (.xls format) can also be accessed through the main repository in the 'rawdata' folder along with the final published press releases (folder: 'Trial Press releases') and news articles (folder: 'Trial News articles').
